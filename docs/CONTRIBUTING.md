## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive. We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/stellar-tipz.git
   cd stellar-tipz
   ```
3. **Set upstream** remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/akan_nigeria/stellar-tipz.git
   ```
4. Follow the [Setup Guide](./SETUP.md) to configure your local environment

---

## Workflow

We use a **fork-and-branch** workflow:

```
1. Fork repo → 2. Create branch → 3. Implement → 4. Test → 5. PR → 6. Review → 7. Merge
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Sync your fork** before starting new work:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch-name>
   ```

3. **Implement** the changes described in the issue

4. **Test** your changes:
   - **Contract changes**: `cd contracts && cargo test`
   - **Frontend changes**: `cd frontend-scaffold && npm run build`

5. **Commit** with a clear message (see [Commit Messages](#commit-messages))

6. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` on the upstream repo

## Branch Naming

Use this convention:

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>` | `feat/12-send-tip-function` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` | `fix/25-withdraw-overflow` |
| Test | `test/<issue-number>-<short-description>` | `test/30-credit-score-tests` |
| Docs | `docs/<issue-number>-<short-description>` | `docs/5-contract-spec-update` |

---

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer: Closes #<issue-number>]
```

### Types

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no feature/fix) |
| `ci` | CI/CD changes |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |

### Examples

```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests are written for new functionality
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

### PR Description

Use the [PR template](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Include:

1. **What** — What does this PR do?
2. **Why** — Link to the issue it resolves
3. **How** — Brief technical approach
4. **Testing** — How you verified it works
5. **Screenshots** (for frontend changes)

### Review Timeline

- PRs are reviewed within **48 hours**
- Address review feedback promptly
- Maintainer will merge once approved

---

## Code Standards

### Rust (Smart Contracts)

- **Format**: Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Lint**: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass with zero warnings
- **Tests**: Every public function must have tests
- **Documentation**: Add `///` doc comments to public functions and types
- **Error handling**: Use custom `ContractError` enum, never `panic!`

### TypeScript (Frontend)

- **Lint**: ESLint must pass (`npm run lint`)
- **Types**: No `any` types — use proper TypeScript types
- **Components**: Functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Imports**: Absolute imports from `src/` using tsconfig paths

### General

- No hardcoded secrets or private keys
- No `console.log` in production code (use proper error handling)
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
