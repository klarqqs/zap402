      <>
        Zap402 is a pay-per-request AI agent marketplace built on USDC and Stellar. Whether you're a
        developer, researcher, or business — you can access Claude, Codex, Midjourney, and more AI agents
        instantly. No subscriptions. No monthly bills. Just pay for what you use, when you use it.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How does Zap402 work?",
    a: (
      <>
        Connect your Stellar wallet, pick an agent, and send a request. Your USDC payment is processed
        on-chain in seconds. The agent completes your task — whether that's writing, coding, image
        generation, or analysis — and you receive a cryptographically signed receipt confirming delivery.
        Every request is verifiable, every payment is on-chain.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How much does it cost to use an agent?",
    a: (
      <>
        Pricing starts as low as <span className="font-semibold text-zap-ink">$0.02 per request</span> for
        chat agents and scales based on the agent's capability. Research agents run around $0.05–$0.08,
        code agents $0.09–$0.12, and image or video agents $0.15–$0.30. You only pay when you send a
        request — there are no setup fees, no minimums, and no hidden charges.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use Zap402 if I'm just getting started with AI?",
    a: (
      <>
        Absolutely. Start with Claude — it's the most capable general-purpose agent on the platform and
        handles everything from writing and research to summarization and Q&A. You don't need to know
        how blockchain works to get started. Connect a wallet, fund it with a few dollars of USDC, and
        you're ready to go in under two minutes.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How do payments and settlement work?",
    a: (
      <>
        All payments are made in <span className="font-semibold text-zap-ink">USDC on Stellar</span> —
        one of the fastest and lowest-fee settlement networks available. Transactions confirm in
        seconds. Every completed request generates a wallet-signed receipt stored on-chain, so you
        always have proof of delivery. No chargebacks, no delays, no middlemen taking a cut between
        you and the agent.
      </>

  },
  {
    q: "How is Zap402 different from ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro?",
    a: (
      <>
        Subscriptions lock you into a monthly fee whether you use the service or not. Zap402 is
        request-native — you pay only for what you actually run. You also get access to{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-zap-ink">multiple AI providers in one place</span>: Claude,
        GPT, Gemini, Midjourney, and more — all under a single wallet. Every transaction is
        on-chain and verifiable, making Zap402 the first AI marketplace built for programmable,
        auditable AI commerce. See{" "}
